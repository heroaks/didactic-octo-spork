Database is an organised collection of data. The data is typically organised to model
aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information.
A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create read update and delete data in a
database


The railway network of our country is one of the most complex public establishments.
You can design a database solution for this network and make the management of the
same more natural. Your system should have the following pieces of information:
Station names
Tracks that connect those stations (to keep things simple, you can assume that only one
track runs between two stations) Train IDs with names
Schedules of the trains
The train schedules should have information on the stations from where the train starts
and by when it reaches the destination. It should also include information on which
stations it passes through during its journey.
To keep things simple, you can assume that every train completes its journey within a
day, and they run daily. However, you’ll also need to store information on the sequence
of the stations a train passes through. For example, if a train starts from Delhi and goes
to Kolkata through Lucknow, then you’ll need to add the arrival and departure times of
the train for all these stations. Keeping the stations in sequence will allow easy
management of trains and their data.
Till here, the project is rather easy. You can make it more challenging by adding the
passenger information of every train such as its coaches, seat numbers, types of
coaches, passenger names, and so on. This project might take some time to complete,
but it’ll help you showcase your knowledge of database management solutions while
solving a significant issue of a public authority.

The main purpose of maintaining database for railway reservation system is to reduce
the manual errors involved in the booking and cancelling of tickets and make it
convenient for the customers and providers to maintain the data about their customers
and also the seats available at them.
This project is about creating the database for railway reservation system.
The aim is to design and develop a database maintaining the records of different trains,
passengers, tracks, stations, schedule and routes.
The project also consists of station names, the tracks that connect those stations,
schedules of the train and the information of the station.
